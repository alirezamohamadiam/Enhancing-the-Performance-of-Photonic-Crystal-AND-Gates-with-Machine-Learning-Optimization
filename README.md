# Enhancing the Performance of Photonic Crystal AND Gates with Machine Learning Optimization

Overview

Recent advancements in photonic crystals have paved the way for the development of high-speed, low-power optical devices. This repository focuses on a novel application of photonic crystals – the optimization of AND gates, which are fundamental components in digital logic circuits. The approach taken involves leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically the Extra Trees Regressor model, to enhance the performance of these optical gates.

Methodology

We employ the Extra Trees Regressor to train on a comprehensive dataset of simulation results. This dataset encompasses various input configurations and parameter settings. The trained model is then utilized to predict the output power for different input and parameter combinations. The evaluation of the model's accuracy reveals a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.18, indicating a high level of precision in predicting output power.

Parameter Optimization

Having established the reliability of our machine learning model, we proceed to identify optimal parameter settings for the photonic crystal AND gate. The parameters under consideration are the radius of the rods (R) and the lattice constant (x). Through the model, we determine that the optimal values for R and x are 0.05 μm and 0.12 μm, respectively.

Conditional Calculations and Gate Functionality

The paper delves deeper into the optimization process by employing predictions from the Extra Trees Regressor for conditional calculations. It meticulously examines the impact of key parameters, such as rod radius and lattice constant, on the functionality of the AND gate. Special emphasis is placed on how these parameters contribute to achieving the desired output states.

Simulation Results

The simulation results presented in the paper provide a comprehensive understanding of the efficacy of the optimized parameters in realizing the behavior of an AND gate within the photonic crystal framework. The findings validate the importance of thoughtful parameter selection in achieving desired optical gate outputs.
